\section{Strategy for testing and evaluation}

\doublespacing
Testing and evalutation of the system will be done in two parts. To start with throughout the development of the the system unit tests will be used to make sure that the system is robust and functional. \\
Once the system is completed a useability case study will be conducted to evaluate how successful the development of the marking system  was and how later versions can be improved.
